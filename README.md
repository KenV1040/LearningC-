# What is this?

This is just a repository for me to store notes and code as I learn C++ while watching a youtube channel called TheCherno.

I'm following along his tutorials to re-learn C++ in-depth

# What is the purpose of this branch?

This is a seperate branch that covers episode 5 to episode 7 of TheCherno's C++ Playlist.

Topics covered in these three episodes are:
- How C++ Works
- How the C++ Compiler Works
- How the C++ Linker Works

# Notes
- In a solution with multiple projects, the solution name should be different to the project.
- In the solution explorer, by default it shows filters, not folders.
- Filter:
  - If you add a filter from visual studio, there won't be a folder on your disk.
  - They are virtual folders
- By pressing "show all files" in the solution explorer, it shows your actual directory on your disk

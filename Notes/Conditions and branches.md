# Notes
- This covers the indepth of version of conditions and branches. Not just basic if else syntax
- The way this works is
  - First, it checks condition
  - Second, it *branches* over to another section of the code
- As a result of the branching, there is some overhead in if statements.
- A lot of optimised code tries to avoid if statements in general.

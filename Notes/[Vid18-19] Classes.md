## Classes vs Structs
- There is basically no difference. **Nice**.
- Class has members private by default
- Struct members is public by default.
- Mainly used for backwards compatibility with C.
- C has Structs, but not classes.
- You can use a #define to re-define structs with classes.
- Cherno likes using structs just to represent Plain Old Data (POD).
  - E.g. a collection of variables and maybe some simple methods.
  - Using classes when you need inheritance.

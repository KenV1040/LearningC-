# Notes

- This will be broken up into two parts:
  1. Breakpoints
  2. Reading Memory
- Diagnosing the problem with the program
- ***You're*** the mistake. Computer is 99% right.

## Breakpoints

- Basically a pause point at a certain line on the program
- Also allows you to inspect the state of memory at that break point
- Step into: Steps into the current function at the breakpoint, assuming it's paused on a function call
- Step over: Steps over the function, and moves on to the line right below.
- Step out: Steps out of the function of whatever function you're currently in.
- If the yellow arrow is on a line of code, it isn't executed yet. It's on that line but paused. The moment you hit the next button it will execute that line of code.

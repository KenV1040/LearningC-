These notes are from [episode 7](https://youtu.be/H4s55GgAg0I)

# General
- If error code begins with a C, it means it's a compiler error
- static functions are only called in the translation unit. (.cpp file)
- 
# Linker
- Even if you don't have other files, it still needs to link the main function
- If you press ctrl+f7, only compiling happens.
- Entry point doesn't have to be a main function. You can customise it in the linker settings
